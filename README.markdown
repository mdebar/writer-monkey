Writer Monkey
=============

*Writer Monkey* is an experiment at attempting to generate text automatically
using Markov chains (resulting in what is basically a [Markov text generator] [1].
It's designed for purely didactic purposes, so the goal is to have a
clean, understandable code base rather than computational efficiency. 

The final result will prove to be nothing more than a clone of [dadadodo] [2]
with a few features for normalization of particular data such as texts written
in Romanian. The coding process as well as the results will be documented on
the [spyked bricks in the wall] [3] (most probably only in Romanian) and the
blog itself will be used as a basis for text generation.
